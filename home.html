     <p> The Best Chewy Gluten-free Chocolate Chip Cookies
 
 


      Recipe from: Michelle @ MyGluten-freeKitchen.com</p>
       
<p>Ingredients:</p>
     
 <ol> 2 1/4 cups (~282 grams) goodall-purpose gluten-free flourblend
       
  <li>1/2 tsp. xanthan gum (omit if gf flour blend has xanthan or guar gum already)</li>
       
  <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
       
  <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
       
  <li>2 ounces cream cheese, room temp</li>
       
  <li>3/4 cups unsalted butter, melted</li>
       
  <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
       
  <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
       
  <li> 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
       
  <li>2 egg yolks (room temp)</li>
       
  <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
       

  <p>Instructions</p>

<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together gluten-free flour, xanthan (unless flour blend already has xanthan or guar gum), baking soda and salt. Set aside.</li>
       
<li>In the bowl of your stand mixer, place the cream cheese, then pour melted butter over it. Add brown sugar and sugar and mix on medium speed for 2 minutes. (I use the paddle attachment on my mixer.)</li>
       
<li>Add vanilla extract and egg yolks (one at a time) mixing on low-medium speed until well mixed.</li>
       
  <li>Add the flour mixture that you set aside earlier, beating on low until just combined.</li>
       
  <li>Add the chocolate chips and mix on low or by hand, just until mixed thoroughly.</li>
       
<li>Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate a minimum of 4 hours and up to 4 days.</li>
       
<li>When you are ready too bake, remove from refrigerator and let sit for about 15 minutes to soften enough for easier scooping.</li>
       
  <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
       
  <li>Line cookie sheets with sheets of parchment paper or silicone liners. Do not spray!</li>
       
<li>Use a#20 cookie scoop to scoop even mounds of cookie dough spaced several inches apart. I can get 12 per cookie sheet.</li>
       
<li>Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes at 375°.
Remove when edges are set and just browning. The centers will look underdone, but will continue cooking as they cool. To ensure you don't overbake, I suggest you bake a few test cookies so you can determine the right baking time for your oven. If you like gooey centers, cook less, if you like crunchier cookies, cook longer.</li>
       
<li>Let the cookies sit on the cookie sheet for just 2-3 minutes before removing to a cooling rack to finish cooling.</li>
