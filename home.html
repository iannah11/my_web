Recipe from: Michelle @ MyGluten-freeKitchen.com
Ingredients
2 1/4 cups (~282 grams) goodall-purpose gluten-free flourblend
1/2 tsp. xanthan gum (omit if gf flour blend has xanthan or guar gum already)
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
2 ounces cream cheese, room temp
3/4 cups unsalted butter, melted
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
2 egg yolks (room temp)
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Instructions

In a medium bowl, whisk together gluten-free flour, xanthan (unless flour blend already has xanthan or guar gum), baking soda and salt. Set aside.
In the bowl of your stand mixer, place the cream cheese, then pour melted butter over it. Add brown sugar and sugar and mix on medium speed for 2 minutes. (I use the paddle attachment on my mixer.)
Add vanilla extract and egg yolks (one at a time) mixing on low-medium speed until well mixed.
Add the flour mixture that you set aside earlier, beating on low until just combined.
Add the chocolate chips and mix on low or by hand, just until mixed thoroughly.
Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate a minimum of 4 hours and up to 4 days.
When you are ready too bake, remove from refrigerator and let sit for about 15 minutes to soften enough for easier scooping.
Preheat oven to 375°.
Line cookie sheets with sheets of parchment paper or silicone liners. Do not spray!
Use a#20 cookie scoop to scoop even mounds of cookie dough spaced several inches apart. I can get 12 per cookie sheet.
Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes at 375°. Remove when edges are set and just browning. The centers will look underdone, but will continue cooking as they cool. To ensure you don't overbake, I suggest you bake a few test cookies so you can determine the right baking time for your oven. If you like gooey centers, cook less, if you like crunchier cookies, cook longer.
Let the cookies sit on the cookie sheet for just 2-3 minutes before removing to a cooling rack to finish cooling.
